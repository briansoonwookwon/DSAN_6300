DSAN 6300: Database Systems and SQL

This course will explore several aspects of modern database management systems, database programming, relational databases, semi-structured databases, and SQL. The course will begin with an introduction to relational models, normal forms and schema design, relational algebra, and SQL Programming. The course will focus on application development using relational databases and will introduce Big Data concepts and discuss Big Data Processing. Both structured and semi-structured data will be considered, such as XML, JSON, and record-style. Query processing methods will be applied and evaluated. Topics will also include recursion in SQL, constraints and triggers, indices and transactions, data storage including column-oriented and distributed storage, noSQL, and different types of databases, such as non-relational, scientific, parallel, and streaming. The course will discuss types of database-system architectures, including cloud-based services. Applications will coincide with data science and analytics, as well as public policy, intelligence generation, and narratives. Tools may also include cloud-based DBMS.
